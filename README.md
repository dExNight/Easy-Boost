# Easy Boost: Enhanced Staking System with Dynamic Reward Mechanisms

## Overview

Easy Boost is an extension for the JVault staking smart contract that introduces a "boost" mechanism for additional token rewards. The project allows any token holder to create temporary boost campaigns, incentivizing long-term staking while increasing the token holder base.

## Key Features

- Fair reward distribution
- Simple web interface for system interaction

## System Benefits
